**Project Overview: Comprehensive Knowledge Search Engine with Chatbot 
Integration**

*Objective: Develop a powerful knowledge search engine leveraging Spark, 
vector databases, and machine learning techniques to enhance user access 
to information from Stack Overflow and YouTube. This project encompasses 
data collection, preprocessing, classification, vectorization, and user 
interaction through a chatbot.*

**Project Components:**

1. **Data Collection and Ingestion:**
    - *Monthly AWS Lambda Execution:* An AWS Event Bridge triggers a 
monthly AWS Lambda function to launch an Airflow EC2 instance.
    - *Airflow Data Collection:* Within the EC2 instance, Airflow 
orchestrates data collection using EMR clusters.
    - *Stack Overflow Data:* The project retrieves Stack Overflow data in 
XML format and loads it into an S3 bucket.
    - *Apache Spark for Data Collection:* Apache Spark processes the raw 
data for XML-to-CSV conversion.
    - *Data Transformation:* Logic is applied to transform the data, 
including label mapping.
    - *S3 Storage:* Processed data is stored in an organized S3 folder 
structure.
2. **Model Embedding and Indexing:**
    - *Sagemaker or Lambda Endpoint:* CSV data from the S3 folder is 
invoked in a SageMaker or Lambda model endpoint.
    - *Model Embeddings:* Embeddings are generated using machine learning 
models.
    - *Elasticsearch Indexing:* Elasticsearch indexing is performed on 
embeddings and indexes are stored in another S3 folder.
    - *EMR Cluster and Apache Spark:* Embeddings and indexes are processed 
using an EMR cluster with Apache Spark.
    - *Final Elasticsearch Deployment:* Processed data is passed to 
Elasticsearch for optimized text search.
3. **User Interaction through Chatbot:**
    - *User Query:* Users interact with a chatbot built with Streamlit or 
Langchain.
    - *Query Processing:* User queries go through a classification and 
embedding model.
    - *Classification and Embedding:* The query is classified and 
embedded.
    - *Elasticsearch Search:* Elasticsearch performs a search returning 
the top relevant results.
    - *Llama 2 Integration:* Results are processed through Llama 2 for 
summarization.
    - *User Output:* Summarized answers and relevant YouTube links with 
start-stop points are communicated to the user via the chatbot.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Data Collection:** AWS Lambda, Airflow, EMR, Apache Spark.
- **Data Preprocessing:** EMR, Apache Spark.
- **Machine Learning:** SageMaker, Lambda, PyTorch, Hugging Face 
Transformers.
- **Data Storage:** AWS S3.
- **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch.
- **User Interaction:** Streamlit, Langchain.
- **Monitoring and Scheduling:** AWS Event Bridge.

**Project Goals:**

- Create an efficient knowledge search engine for Stack Overflow and 
YouTube data.
- Enable users to access information through a user-friendly chatbot.
- Implement robust data collection, preprocessing, and modeling pipelines.
- Optimize text search using Elasticsearch.
- Provide accurate and summarized answers along with relevant YouTube 
links.

This project aims to revolutionize knowledge access by seamlessly 
integrating data collection, machine learning, and user interaction, 
ultimately enhancing the learning experience for students and users 
seeking valuable information.
